Requirements :

PHP5
Cakephp 1.2
Amazon free AWS account: http://aws.amazon.com/

Usage :

Copy the amazon_ecommerce_source.php file to your app/models/datasources/ directory

Add a configuration to your database.php in app/config/

var $soap = array(
    'datasource' => 'amazon_ecommerce',
    'accessKey' => '****' // accesskey of your amazon account
	'secretKey' => '*****' // accesskey of your amazon account
);

Then in your model set:

var $useDbConfig = 'amazon_ecommerce';
var $useTable = false;

And you're ready to go.

In your controller you can now use
$this->Model->query('all', array('type'=>'Music', 'keywords' => 'Rick Astley'));
or
$this->Model->query(array('type'=>'Music', 'keywords' => 'Rick Astley'));
